﻿# Implement the Fraction class according to the following requirements:

## Propeties:
- Numer: Numerator
- Denom: Denominator (default=1, cannot be 0)
- Count: counting #objects of this class (static)
Note: Numerator and Denominator have to in the minimal form.
      See r3 and r6.

## Constructors:
- Fraction (): default constructor
- Fraction (Fraction a): copy constructor
- Fraction (numerator, denominator)
note: increment the Count property when an object is created

## Methods
- setValue: set fraction value
- GCD: calculate Greatest Common Divisor of two integers (static)

## Operator Overloading:
many many operators need to be overloaded!!! 

## Question?
1. Is the number of Fraction objects equal to the 'new' keywords used
   in the 'main' methods? How come?
	No, they are not equal to each other. Because the new keyword can also use to create temporary objects (increase _count variable too) 
   and use for some purposes, that are not to create a new object(by constructors).The number of Fraction objects is not only belong to a number of new keywords.

2. Are the result, r3 and r7, in case#1 and case#2 the same? Why?
	No. In the case#1 we use new Fraction(r3) to create a object that has same attributes as r3 and create r7 from this object. 
	So _count will be increased by 1 from using new Fraction. 
	In the case#2 we use r7 = r3 that just assign all of the r3's attributes to r7. So the _count variable won't be changed.


## Expected Output:

***** 3 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 8 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 12 Fraction objects have been created *****

[Rational: 2/1], value=2]
